*--BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFUSION IN PLANTS--*

1. Movement of carbon dioxide through the stomata of the leaves during transpiration and 
photosynthesis. 
2. Movement of oxygen into the leaves through the stomata during respiration 
3. Movement of the manufactured food from the leaves to other parts of the plants. 

*BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFUSION IN ANIMALS*

1. Gaseous exchange in any cells and organisms e.g. amoeba obtains oxygen by diffusion. 
2. Exchange of nutrients and oxygen between a foetus and the mother through the placenta. 
3. Gaseous exchange in the lungs of mammals 
4. Absorption of food from the small intestine through the villi into the blood stream. 

*OSMOSIS*

Is the movement of water or solvent molecules from a region of dilute or a weaker 
solution to a region of concentrated of stronger solution through a selectively permeable 
membrane (semi-permeable membrane). 

*CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR OSMOSIS TO TAKE PLACE*

i. Presence of a stronger solution e.g. salt solution ii. Presence 
of a weaker solution e.g. water iii. Presence of a semi-
permeable membrane 

*LIVING CELLS AS OSMOMETER*

A living cell is usually surrounded by a medium which can be described as hypertonic, 
hypotonic and isotonic. 

A. HYPERTONIC: When the cell is surrounded by a stronger solution, water will be lost 
by the cell. The cell shrinks. 

B. HYPOTONIC: When a cell of a living organism is surrounded by water or solution 
whose concentration is lower, water passes into the cell by osmosis. 

C. ISOTONIC: When the solute concentration of the cell and its surrounding medium are 
the same, the solution is said to be isotonic. No net movement of molecules
