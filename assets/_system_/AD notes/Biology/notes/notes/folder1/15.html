*--THE CELL AND ITS ENVIRONMENT--*

DIFFUSION: Is the process by which molecules of gas or ions move from a region of high 

concentration to a region of low concentration until they are evenly distributed. FACTORS 

CONTROLLING DIFFUSION: The rate of diffusion is controlled by a number of factors 
which include: 

i. State of matter: (Gas moves faster than the liquid& solids 
ii. Molecular size (Smaller 
molecules diffuses faster than big ones) 
iii. Difference in concentration (the greater the 
differences in the concentration of the molecules, the greater the rate of diffusion. 
iv. Temperature: High temperature increase the speed at with molecules move 
(The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of diffusion) 

*EXPERIMENT TO DEMONSTRATE DIFFUSION IN LIQUIDS* 

Beaker, water, pipette, potassium permanganate crystals/solution take a beaker and fill 
it with water. Use pipette to deliver small quantity of potassium permanganate solution 
(crystals) gently at the bottom of the beaker and leave it to stand for few minutes. 
The purple colour of the potassium permanganate solution starts to spread outside until 
the colour spreads evenly throughout the water medium so that the water have the same shade 
of purple colour. 

*EXPERIMENT TO DEMONSTRATE DIFFUSION IN GASES*

Material: Bottles of Ammonia solution 
Method: Take a bottle of ammonia solution, open the bottle and move some distance away 
from the bottle and wait for sometime

Observation: The smell of the ammonia gas spread to all corners of the classroom. 

Conclusion: The smell perceived everywhere in the classroom shows that diffusion of 
ammonia gas has taken place
