*--PLANT NUTRITION--*

Nutrition is defined as the process by which living organisms obtain and utilize food material from external environment for metabolic activities such as respiration, growth, excretion and reproduction.

Photosynthetic or holophytic Nutrition is defined as a process whereby green plant manufacture their own organic food from simple inorganic substances such as carbon (iv) oxide, water, sunlight and chlorophyll producing oxygen as by- product. The process can be summarized by equation as shown below
6CO2+6H2O          Sunlight energy            C6H12O6+6CO2
  	                  Chlorophyll 

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages namely the LIGHT REACTION and the DARK REACTION.
The first stage which is the light reaction is dependent on light. The light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll is used to break water into hydroxyl (OH-) and hydrogen (H+) ions. The process of splitting water molecule by light energy into hydroxyl and hydrogen ions is called PHOTOLYSIS. The importance of this stage is to transfer the light energy to chemical energy of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) and make reduced NADP (Nicotinamide Adenine dinuclestide phosphate). In the dark, this energy is converted to chemical energy in organic compound.

The main product formed during photosynthesis is simple sugar. The simple sugar formed is partly used by the plant and excess of it is converted to starch immediately for starch immediately for storage. The starch is then transported to other part of the plant through the phloem vessel for storage in the process of TRANSLOCATION.

*Importances of Photosynthesis*

i.	Production of food for living things
ii.	The process purifies atmosphere by making use of carbon (iv) oxide in the air
iii.	It maintain oxygen balance of the atmosphere by release more
iv.	It serves as a building block for other substances to be formed e.g. protein and oil

*CHEMOSYNTHETIC NUTRITION*

This is a process where certain bacteria which are autotrophs manufacture their own food from simple inorganic substance such as carbon (iv) oxide, water, hydrogen sulphide by using the chemical energy released during the process as their source of energy. The bacteria have enzyme system capable of trapping chemical energy.
For example, the Sulphur bacteria in the soil can oxidize hydrogen sulphide around it to chemical energy
