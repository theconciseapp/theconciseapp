i.	All are multicellular organisms
ii.	DNA is located in nucleus enclosed with nuclear membrane
iii.	Cells have no cell walls
iv.	All possess nervous systems except the sponges
v.	All possess true tissue except sponges
vi.	Feeding is heterotrophic
	
*The Kingdom is divided into two major groups*

(i)	INVERBRATA: These are groups of animal without backbone
(ii)	VERTEBRATA: These are groups of animal that have backbone
	The classification of animals into smaller categories is based on features such as:
(i)	Body Symmetry
(ii)	Body design
(iii)	Body cavity

*Body symmetry is based on the fact that the body of the animal has similar or corresponding parts in size, shape and position on opposite sides of a dividing line or a median plane*
	
Types

1.	Radial symmetry means the body of the animal can be cut along its axis in any place to give two identical halves
ii.	Bilateral symmetry means the body of the animal can be cut along its axis in only one place to give two identical halves.
	Body design is the way the body of the animal is shaped or framed whether it has one or two exits
i.	Sac-like body design: Those animals that have single opening (mouth) that lead to the gut cavity 
ii.	Tubular body design: Those animals have double opening like tube with gut opening at the anterior (mouth) and posterior (anus)
	Body Cavity: A developing embryo of animal has primary layer of cell called germ layer differentiated to form various body parts. The tissue of primitive animals are derived from two layers of cells, the ectoderm and endoderm such animal is called Diploblastic animal e.g. Hydra.
	Most animals are derived from three germs layers ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, such animal are called triploblastic animal.
	Animal that have three germ layers can be further derived into:
i.	Acoelomate: animal without body cavity
ii.	Pseudo coelomate: animal with false body cavity
iii. 	Coelomate: animal with true body cavity
        
*The member of phylum invertebrate*
