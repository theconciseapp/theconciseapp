An ecosystem is defined as a community of plants, animals and decomposers that interact with one another and with the non-living components of the environment, the balance in ecosystem may be interrupted by man through various activities such as 

1.	BUSH CLEARING: is the act of clearing the bush by cutting down trees, clearing the shrubs and grasses for agricultural activities
	
EFFECT

- It exposes the soil to direct sunshine which may increase the temperature of the soil which may not favour the microorganism living within
	- Removal of plants and trees exposes the soil to the threat of erosion
	- Unprotected land or soil is subjected to leaching of nutrient by natural factor
	- Extensive bush clearing may lead to desertification
	- It may lead to migration or displacement of bush animals
	- Bush clearing affects the existing ecosystem and set back succession of plants
	- Bush clearing destroys conservation of plants species useful in other way.

2.BUSH BURNING: is defined as a deliberate or in deliberate act of setting the bush on 	fire either        with a purpose or not at all
	
EFFECTS
	
- It kills both animals and microorganism within the engulfed area
	- It may lead to gradual loss of soil fertility
	- The burnt ashes may give the soil a slight alkaline content
	- It will exposes the soil to both wind and rain erosion
	- It takes longer time for micro-organism to return to the burnt soil
	- It may reduce the water-retaining capacity of the soil
	- Some plant species destroyed by the fire may not regenerate again on the soil
	- The balanced ecosystem is totally destroyed.
	- During burning some of the nutrients vapourise from the soil
            Few Advantages
	- It renews the growth of dried up grasses easily (succession_
	- It promotes speedy emergency of long dormant seeds of some plants
	- the charcoal and wood are used for cooking

3.	TILLAGE

This is the activity of preparing the soil for use and growing of crops for consumption, storage and processing or Tillage is the practice of loosening the soil after clearing in preparation for growing. Hoes, spades and plough are used to break the soil

EFFECTS
	
- Ploughing loosens the soil and exposes it to erosion
	- It brings about greater ecological changes of the soil
	- Tillage encourages leaching of soil nutrients
	- It damages structure and kill some of the micro-organisms
	- Tillage increases the risk of fire and direct heat on the soil
              Advantages of Tillage
	- It helps in loosening the soil and aid high crop yield
	- it prevents appearance of different set of plants
	- Tillage enhances proper aeration of the soil

4.	FERTILIZER
	
This is a natural or chemical substance which if spread on the land make plant grow well.
            
TYPES

- Organic fertilizer is a natural component which may include manure; fish meal and compost which are biologically origin and contain organic material are biologically origin and contain organic material
- Chemical fertilizer are chemical substance that are artificial in nature, they are described by their content e.g. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and potassium (NPK)
  
*PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES*

*A pesticide* is a chemical compound used in agriculture to destroy organisms that can damage crops or stored food especially insect and rodent. Examples are insecticide and fungicide 

*A Herbicide* is a chemical substance that kill plant or hamper their growth. It is known as weed-killer. It includes defoliants (contact herbicide) which kill only the parts they touch and selective herbicide which kill only certain plants and spare other.

Insecticides are chemical substance used to kill insects

EFFECTS
	
- It lead to loss of organic humus
- Chemical fertilizer when permeates can destroy the soil crumb structures
- Chemical such as herbicide and pesticide when washed down to the river can cause water pollution
- Extensive use of chemical fertilizer make soil dry and powdery and make it susceptible to wind erosion
- Chemical fertilizer can kill useful soil organisms when come in direct contact with them

EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT KIND OF FARMING ON ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM

CROP ROTATION

This is a method of farming system which accommodates the division of land into sections and on a different land, a different crop is planted on each section. The method reduces the risk of serious diseases infestations and soil depletion. Legumes are very important in crop rotation as it is believed to restores the nitrogen content of the soil or it adds nitrates to the soil. In crop rotation a surface feeder e.g. maize is planted along with deep feeder e.g. cassava. A surface feeder is a plant which grows near the surface and a deep feeder is a plant with firm root in the soil.

*Benefit of crop rotation*
	
- It allows the land to fallow
	- It prevents erosion
	- It increases the yield or crops
	- It prevent disease infestation
	- It adds nitrate to the soil
	- Nutrients of the soil are not depleted



*MIXED FARMING*
	
This is the system of farming that integrate both animal production and crop production on same farm.
            
Benefits
	
- It allows the animals to convert plant products to high quality protein needed by man
	- It allays the fear of single crop failure
	- The system is economically viable as the farmer makes money from both crop and animals.

*MIXED CROPPING*

This is a system of farming whereby the former grows more than one type of crop on a piece of land at the same time.

*--ADVERSE FARMING METHOD--*

*CONTINUOUS CROPPING:* 

This is a system of farming where a piece of land is permanently put under cultivation of crops

EFFECT 
	- The system leads of exhaution of essential minerals in the soil
	- Cost of clearing is reduced as only an area is prepared for production
	- Low productivity may be recorded after some years of using the land.
	- There may be possibility of crop failure

*MONOCULTURE OR MONOCROPPING:*

This is the system of farming that involves practice of growing the same crop on the same piece of land every year.

EFFECT

	- It makes the environment unsuitable for many crops after few year
	- The system encourages increased spread of both parasite and plant diseases
	- The system can lead to crop failure which will affect the farmer financially
	- The practices quickens the exhaustion and destruction of soil structure



*SHIFT CULTIVATION*

This is a system of farming where a piece of land is cultivated for either two or more years until the farmer notices low crop yield and abandons the farm land for another new piece of land.

EFFECT
	
- It leads to deforestation
	- It leads to wastage of land
	- it exposes the land to erosion
	- It leads to migration of animals


*THE PEST*

A Pest is an insect or a small animal which can damage crops, spread diseases to man and other animals.

Types of Plant Pest

i.	Insect Pest: These are insects that are harmful to plant and cause damages to crop on field and at storage
ii.	Crop eating insects can damage crops in various ways, their larvae chew their way into the roots while above surface insects feed on leaves, flowers and seeds./
b.	Sap-sucking insect: This group of insects constitute major problem, they weaken plant by stealing the energy rich sugar in sap and they also spread viruses that can cause disease. Example is aphid . 
c.	Biting and chewing insects: They have the ability to destroy crops by eating up the leaves of young crops like maize, guinea corn, yam and vegetables.
d.	Piercing and sucking insects: These are insect pests having mouth parts adapted for piercing and sucking of crops. They pierce into young developing fruits, seeds and young stems and suck up the sap. Some of them inject poisonous chemicals into their saliva and cause distortion in growth of attached crop. Examples are cotton stainer, mealy bud, weevils and aphids

2	WORM PESTAND BORER
	
Some worms are subterranean, they feed on juicy roots of plants and destroy them making such plants to fall e.g. corn, while other worms chew their way up and feed on leaves, stems, flowers and feed  of plant.

(a) 	Pod borer: They bore into fresh pod, eat up the seeds, introduce diseases and leave the pod to decay e.g. beans and soya beans
(b)	Stem borer: They bore holes into stem of crops, eat up the tissue and weakens the plant support e.g. maize, sorghum and millet
(c)	Army worm: The larvae of the worm engulf leaves and stem which retard growth and plant nutrient and reduce farm yield of crops e.g. maize, millet and sorghum

3.	ANIMAL PEST: These are animals either mammals or birds which destroy crops on the field

(a)	Mammal pest: They can invade maize farm and consume it to reduce the level of harvest. They can also destroy ripped palm fruit, yam and cassava crops example are monkeys, grass-cutter, ground squirrel, bush rat or rodent
(b)	Bird pest: They destroy grain farm within few days. They feed on young and dry corn, punch cassava and yam tubes and destroy groundnut. They can also feed on grains and banana e.g. bushes fowl, guinea fowl, village weaver birds.


EFFECT OF PEST

i.	insect pests such as grasshoppers can destroy the vegetation of several kilometres within few days
ii	Pests compete in feeding with humans and their effect can lead to scarcity or famine
iii.	Crop pests reduce the quality and quantity of infested crops, seeds and fruit
iv.	They can cause financial disaster for farmers when they attacked and destroy stored produce
v.	They make the farmer to spend much money on pesticides and other method of control
vi.	Some of the pests are agent of disease carrier deadly to both man and plant
             Control Of Pests
1.	Chemical control is by the use of chemical substance that will bring about the killing of the pest e.g. Aldrin and vertox 85, Gammalin 20 and Didimac 25
ii.	Cultural method of control involves the use of season, crop rotation, regular weeding, correct spacing and early harvest to confront the menace cause by pest
iii.	Physical method of control includes the use of scaring, killing and collecting pest for mass destruction. It also involves setting of traps, shooting, catapulting, scare-crows and the use of farm drum.
iv.	Biological control: it involves introduction of natural enemies of the pest to consume the pest or to keep their population under control
  Life cycle of yam Beetle
The pest destroys large quantities of yam tubers annually by making hole or boring into the tubers. They bore into the tubers. The beetles live in the soil and in breeding seasons, they lay their eggs in damp places between November and December. The eggs hatch into larvae feeding on decaying matter at first, then on the root of grasses. They change into pupa and by March the adult beetle emerges and set off for feeding migration normally between April and June. They burrow themselves into the soil and it is here that they attack the yam tubers. They continue feeding up to October before setting off on breeding migration in November-December to seek damp places to lay their eggs and the cycle begins again.
