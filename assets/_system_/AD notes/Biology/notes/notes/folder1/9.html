*--ANIMAL NUTRITION (FOOD SUBSTANCES)--*

Food is a complex energy-rich organic matter which living organism feed on to obtain nutrients and substances necessary for life. Food substances are classified to six groups

(i) Carbohydrate     
(ii) Protein       
(iii) Fat and oils    
(iv)  Mineral salts  
(v) Vitamins     
(vi) Water and roughages.

Carbohydrates are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They have general formula (CxH2O)y. carbohydrate consists of simple sugar, starches, cellulose and glycogen. They are grouped into simple sugar or monosaccharide, double sugar/disaccharides and poly saccharide. The common sources include yam, cassava, potatoes, bread, cereals e.g. rice, maize e.t.c.

*Simple sugar or Monosaccharide*

These are the simplest sugar which consists of one molecule of simple sugars. They have general formula C6H10O6. Examples are glucose, fructose and ribose (C5H10O5) or galactose

*Disaccharide/Reducing sugar*

These are sugars which consist of two molecules of simple sugar which formed by condensation with the general formula C12H22O11. Examples are sucrose, maltose and lactose

Sucrose: It is a non-reducing sugar which is formed from a molecule of glucose and a molecule of glucose is the main source
Maltose: This is obtained from the condensation of two molecules of simple sugar. It is reducing sugar
Lactose (milk-sugar): It is a reducing sugar. It is obtained from the condensation of a molecule of glucose and a molecule of galactose

*Polysaccharide*

	These are complex carbohydrates. Examples are starch, cellulose, chitin and inulin.

1.	Starch: It has the formula C6H10O5)n where n represent a large number. It is formed from the condensation of numerous molecules of simple sugar. Examples of the sources of starch are yam, cereals, cassava and bread
ii.	Cellulose: This is composed of several condensed unit of monosaccharides. It makes the cell wall of plant source of cellulose include whole meal bread, cereals, fresh fruit and vegetables.
iii.	Glycogen (Animal starch): This is the form which animals store their carbohydrate usually in the muscle or liver
      
*Importance of Carbohydrate*

i.	It provides energy required by animals for their daily activities
ii.	It provides heat during it oxidation used in maintain the body temperature
iii.	It forms certain body part of arthropods (exoskeleton)
iv.	The mucus which is an important lubricant in the body is formed carbohydrate

*PROTEIN*

Proteins are complex molecules and are made of smaller unit called amino acids. Proteins have to be digested to amino acids before they are absorbed in the body of animal. The breakdown of proteins during digestion takes place in the following
Protein         ->          Peptone        ->           Polypeptide         ->          Amino acid

Protein is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur

Sources of protein include both animal source and plant source

The animal source includes milk, egg, fish, cheese, meat and chicken while the Plant sources are beans, groundnut, soya beans and melon.

*Importance of Protein*

i.	Protein is needed for growth of young ones
ii.	It is used for the repair of worn out tissues or cells
iii.	It aids reproduction
iv.	It is used for the production of enzymes
v.	It is needed for the production of hormone
vi.	It is needed for body building57

*FATS AND OIL*

Fat and oils are also called lipids. They consist of only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. However, the amount of oxygen in each lipid is very little e.g. tristearin, is C57H10O6. Fats are solid lipid at room temperature. Plant sources of oil include groundnut, palm oil, soya beans oil; coconut oil and melon oil white animal sources of fat include butter, fish or cod oil.
Fat and oil are hydrolysed during digestion to fatty acid and glycerol

*Importance of Fat and Oil*

i.	Fat and oil provides more energy to animal than carbohydrate
ii.	Fat supplies essential fatty acid to animal
iii.	Fat and oil act as solvent for fat soluble vitamins
iv.	They help in the maintenance of body temperature
v.	They act as insulator to animal which help them to conserve heat

*MINERAL SALT*

Mineral salts are food substances that are required in traces for vital body process. They are taken in their ionic forms. Animal takes in their elements mainly by feeding on plants or their products except a few of them such as sodium chloride (table salt). Lack of mineral salts will result in nutritional deficiency. These mineral elements or salts include phosphorus, calcium, iodine, manganese, fluorine, copper and cobalt.
