<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-1">*--BIOLOGY AS A SCIENCE--*

The word Biology comes from two Greek words _Bios_, which means life and _logos_ which 
means study. A biologist is a scientist who studies living things. He makes use of common 
processes and attributes of sciences. The processes are: 
 
- Making an accurate observations 
- Identification of problems and plan experiments or investigations under 
controlled situations 
- Predicts or formulates hypothesis 
- Analyze results from collected data 
- Making reasonable inferences, draw defendable and acceptable conclusion.

The scientific methods adopted by the biologist are: 

i.  *Hypothesis:* This is the tentative answers given in to a particular problem or question. 
ii. *Experimentation:* This is the act of setting up experiment to test the tentative answers 
given to the questions or the hypothesis. 
iii. *Variables:* These are the conditions on which experiment is set up. The result is got 
through variation of the variables. 
iv. *Control experiment:* This is set up to justify the main experiment. This is achieved by 
not allowing the variable under investigation to change (i.e remain constant). 
v. *Theory:* This is tested and acceptable hypothesis vi. Law: This is the generalization 
made from the inferences of many scientists about a particular experiment after 
obtaining a similar results.

<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-2">*--ATTRIBUTES/ATTITUDES OF A BIOLOGIST--*
i. *Curiosity:* Strong desire to find out 
ii. *Objectivity:* Respect for other scientist feeling and findings 
iii. *Open mindedness:* Changing of mind to accommodate new discoveries 
iv. *Critical mindedness:* Probing into scientific investigations before accepting its 
correctness 
v. *Suspending judgment:* He concludes after the collection of enough information. 
vi. *Perseverance:* He takes pain and time in designing and carrying out his experiment 
vii. *Carefulness:* He takes caution in the procedure of the experiment
viii. *Rationality:* He explains the natural phenomenon in terms of natural causes rather than 
magic or spirits. 
ix. *Humility:* He is naturally humble 
x. *Honesty:* Honest in scientific processes and procedure 
xi. *Accuracy:* The Observations and the results must be accurately recorded

<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-3">*--USEFULNESS OF BIOLOGY--*

1. It helps man to understand the structure of his body and how it works 
2. It helps man to discover several mechanisms and methods of treatments, scientific 
testing, effective drug administrations, immunization and disease prevention. 
3. It helps man to increase good production, preservation and breeding of more productive 
breeds of plants and animals. 
4. It also helps in pollution control in our environment. 
5. It helps in the area of single cell protein production by micro organisms. 
6. Biological researchers and development of new tools and techniques have led to an 
improved quality of life. 
7. Study of biology has helped to promote the understanding of man and his immediate 
environment 
8. It helps in the use of naturally occurring bacteria to clean up oil spills and toxic 
chemicals 
9. The in vitro fertilization (i.e fertilization outside the body of an organism) helps infertile 
couple to have children 
10. It proves the fact that when living things die, their substances returns to the realm of 
non-living things.

<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-4">*--BRANCHES OF BIOLOGY--*

- Anatomy: Study of tissues and its functions 
- Physiology: Study of normal functions of living things 
- Morphology: This is the form and the structure of living organism 
- Ecology: The interaction between living and non living components of an environment 
in which energy is used and recirculated. 
- Embryology: Scientific study of embryo. 
- Genetic: Scientific study of different ways by which characters are passed from parents 
to the offsprings.
- Evolution: Scientific study of gradual development of living things as they adapt to 
different environmental changes over a long period of time. 

*The main branches of Biology are:*

a. BOTANY: The study of plants 
b. ZOOLOGY: The study of animals 
</div>
<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-5">--*BIOLOGY AS THE STUDY OF LIVING THINGS*--

Biology can be simply defined as the study of organisms with the proof of life. The 
proof of life in this content, are the evidences that they are living things and these are called the 
characteristics of living things. 
</div>
<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-6">--*GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING THINGS*--

1. Movement: The ability to move the whole or part of the body using energy produced by 
the organism 
2. Nutrition: This is the assimilation of food substances needed for respiration and growth. 
3. Respiration: The breakdown of food substances to release energy 
4. Reproduction: The production o new individuals of the same kind for the 
continuation of life 
5. Irritability: Ability to respond to stimulus from the environment 
6. Adaptation: The possession of features which enables organism to live successfully and 
to survive in their respective environments. 
7. Growth: An irreversible increase in body size, weight and complexity due to synthesis 
of fresh protoplasm from nutrient materials. 
8. Limited size: All living things exhibit growth to a limit expected of its kind, forinstant, 
goat can not grow to the size of an elephant. 
9. Excretion: The removal of waste products of metabolism produced by the chemical 
process in the body of an organism 
10. Death: Living things cannot live for life, at a certain stage of life, they will die or cease 
to live.

<div class="sub-topic" id="sub-topic-7">*--CLASSIFICATION OF LIVING THINGS--*

Classification is defined as the arrangement of living things into groups based on structural genetic and cellular organization.  This is called TAXANOMY.The system of classification of living things  used today is based on that introduced by Swedish naturalist named Carl Von Linne(1707-1778).His name was better known in Latin as Carolus Linnaeus.He published the classification of plant 1753 and that of animal in 1758.
Living things are first separated into large group called KINGDOM. The division of kingdom smaller group called PHYLA (PHYLUM). The term division rather than phylum is usually used for plant. Phyla are divided into smaller groups called CLASSES. Each class is further divided into ORDER. Orders are further divided into smaller unit called FAMILIES. Families are again divided into GENERA (genius). A genius is broken into SPECIES. A species is a population of related organism that can interbreed within themselves to produce a fertile offspring. Genius is a group of closely related species. A family is a group of genera. An Order is a group of related families. A class is a group of related order. A phylum is a group of related classes. A kingdom is a group of related phyla.

Living things according to modern classification system which is based on physiology, biochemistry and embryology are classified into five kingdoms; MONERA, PROTOCTISTA, FUNGI, PLANTAE AND ANIMALIA.

*MONERA* (Characteristics.	

i. They lack organized DNA i.e. the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is scattered in the cytoplasm an not in nucleus hence they are called prokaryotes.
ii.	They have no mitochondrion in their cytoplasm
iii.	Their cell wall lack cellulose, their cell wall is made up of protein and fatty materials
iv.	They are microscopic single called organism
v.	Some are motile while some are non-motile
vi.	They feed both auto tropically and heterotrophic ally. Blue green bacterium & blue green algae
vii.	The reproduce only by asexual mean.

*KINGDOM PROTOCYISTA* (Characteristics)

i.	They have well organized DNA in the nucleus bounded by nuclear membrane hence they are called eukaryotes
ii.	They are single called organism or unicellular organism
iii.	Some are motile while some are non-motile
iv.	They live in water, damp soil, leaf litter and other terrestrial habitats that have sufficient moist.
v.	All protists use mitochondrion for cellular respiration
vi.	They form cyst to survive adverse condition
vii.	They all reproduce both sexually and asexually Examples are Amoeba, Euglena, Chlamydomonas, Plasmodium.
Example of Monera are:  bacteria and photosynthetic blue green bacterium also known as blue green algae.

*KINGDOM FUNGI* (Characteristics)

i.	They all feed heterotrophic ally because they lack chlorophyll therefore cannot photosynthesize.
ii.	They are simple multicellular organism that grow like plant but are not plant because they are not green in colour.
iii.	Their bodies are not divided into true root, stem and leaves
iv.	They are mostly non-motile organisms composed of thread-like multinucleate hyphae collectively known as mycelium
v.	They reproduce by means of spores. Spores are unicellular microscopic structure that is capable of germinating to a new organism.
vi.	The fungi stores carbohydrate as glycogen just like animal not as starch as done by plant
vii.	Their cell wall is made up of chitin and not cellulose like plant
	Examples are Mucor, Rhizopus, Mushroom and Slime mould.

*KINGDOM PLANTAE* (Characteristic)
i.	They are multicellular and non-motile organisms
ii.	Their cells are bounded by rigid cellulose cell walls external to cell membrane
iii.	They contain chlorophyll that enables them to manufacture their own food by photosynthesis
iv.	Most plants store carbohydrates as starch or sucrose.

*--CLASSIFICATION OF KINGDOM PLANTAE BASED ON BOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION--*
	The kingdom plantae is divided into four main phyla or Division

(i)	Thallophyta (algae)
	-  They are simple microscopic plant
	- They have no true root, stem and leaves
	- They are found in aquatic habitat
	-They are autotrophic plant i.e. They can synthesize their own food
	- They reproduce both by asexual means and sexual means
	- They have cellulose cell wall
	- Many of them are pigmented such as red, blue, brown in addition to chlorophyll.
	- Some are filamentous (algae) and the cells are not differentiated into tissue

(ii) Bryophyte (Moss and liverwort) 
	- They are non-vascular multicellular plant
	- They have chlorophyll as the only photosynthetic pigment
	- They are terrestrial but grow in moist environment
	- Their body is differentiated into stem-like and leaf-like structure but no true root, stem and leaves
	- They have no vascular tissue therefore they are unable to transport food and material round the body
- They reproduce asexually by means of spores while sexual reproduction by gametes and it takes place in water
- They exhibit what is called alternation of generation.

Division Pteridophyta (ferns)
- Their body is divided into true root, stem and leaves
- They have well developed vascular bundles comprising of xylem and phloem
- The underground stem is rhizome
- They reproduce by means of spores
- They need water of sexual reproduction which is by gametes formation
- The plants are mostly terrestrial while few are aquatic
- They exhibit alternation of generation
- They  have asexual reproductive organ called sori while the sexual reproductive organ is heart- shaped called prothalus

SPERMATOPHYTA
- They are seed bearing plant
- They have well-developed vascular bundles
- They are well-adapted to terrestrial habitat and they are the most successful land plants

The Spermatophyta are divided into two:

(i)	Division Gymnospermatophyta or Coniferophyta
- They are large plant with well-developed vascular bundle with true root, stem and        leaves
- Their leaves are green in colour, small and needle-like
-  Their naked seeds are born in cone because there is no ovary and no fruit

(ii) Division Angiospermatophyta
- They possess true flowers for sexual reproduction
- They have well-developed true root, stem and leaves
- They have well-developed vascular bundles
- Seeds and fruits are produced after fertilization and the seed are enclosed within the ovary
- They are terrestrial but some are aquatic
- They are terrestrial but some are aquatic
	
  The Angiospermatophyta is divided into two classes

i.	Monocotylenoneae (Monocot)
ii.	Dicotyledoneae (Dicot)


Monocotyledoneae	/			Dicotyledonea
i.  Leaves have parallel veins          /            Leaves have network veins               
ii. Flowers are generally dull in colour   /    Flowers are bright in colour
iii. Embryo has one cotyledon (one seed  /  Embryo has two cotyledons (two seed- leaves)
      Leaf
iv. The size of cortex is narrow        /          The size of the cortex is wide
v.   It has fibrous root system        /           It has tap root system
vi.  Cambium is absent in the stem      /        Cambium is present in the stem
vii. Vascular bundles are scattered all   /     Vascular bundle are arranged in a ring of cambium
       over the ground tissue
      Example Maize, palm tree, grasses   /   Examples are Mango, Orange.
