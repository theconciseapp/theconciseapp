  <b>THEFT</b><br/>
<br/>We wish to remind you that the school is in no way responsible for theft that takes place within the school.
<br/>Students are therefore responsible for their belongings. Secondary School students have a locker for their belongings. It 
<br/>remains the responsibility and the appreciation of families to allow students to have objects of value with them at school.<br/>
