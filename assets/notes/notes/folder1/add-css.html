*CSS:* it simple means Cascading Style Sheet- CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document i.e it's a simple mechanism for adding styles( fonts, color, background, positioning e.t.c) to your web document like html.  
CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

I will teach you at least two ways to add css styles to a WebView page.

1. Linking to a .css file that contains all css styles
2. Adding the styles directly in an html page

*--Number 1:--*
[img=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/photos/imported-files.png][/img]

let's add css file *(my-styles.css)* in our WebView page(hello.html),
+s+_( You can create *my-styles.css* on App Builder by clicking on plus(+) icon in *Assets*, after creating it, open it and enter <code>h1{ color: blue; background: red; }</code>, then close it and follow the instruction below )_+s+

- Open *hello.html*
- Put <code>&lt;link href="file:///assets/my-styles.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>
+s+_(Put it immediately after &lt;html&gt;)_+s+
[img=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/photos/add-css.png][/img]
- Build and launch your app

+s+(Remember to remove &lt;style&gt;h1{ color: white; }&lt;/style&gt; inside *hello.html*, since all our styles will now be inside *my-styles.css*)+s+

*--Number 2:--* Adding the css styles directly in an html page

- Open hello.html
- Put 
<code>&lt;style&gt;
  h1{ color: white; background: indigo; }
  /*Other styles*/
&lt;/style&gt;</code> anywhere after &lt;html&gt; and build your app.

It is best to use the first method as it is more organised in one file and also, using the method reduces the size of our html document.

*Note:* If you want to use external css file (i.e css not created on or imported to app builder i.e css link that starts with https:// or http:// instead of file:///assets), then remember to set permission *INTERNET* in *App Tree* under *Packaging* ( [link=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/packaging.html]Read about Packaging[/link] )
