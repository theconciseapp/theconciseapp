In this lesson, i will show you how to change the texts colour of your webview page (hello.html).
When you created your app, the text's colour is black. That is the default color until it's changed.

You +r+cannot+r+ change the colour of text of a WebView page through the *app tree*. This is why it would be an added advantage if you know or learn HTML and CSS +s+( https://www.w3schools.com )+s+
App Builder guide is not meant to teach you HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT or JQUERY, we will only make use of them only where and when necessary.

To change the text colour from black to white:

1. Open *Assets* under *App Files* of your app
2. Open *hello.html*
In between your &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;, enter
<code>h1{ color: white; }</code> or <code>body{ color: white; }</code>
Instead of colour name (white;), you can also use Css color code: "*#ffffff;*" which also refers to white +s+( _learn more from_ https://www.w3schools.com )+s+

_Full code +s+(you may click code below to copy it)+s+_
<code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
h1{ color: white; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script src="android.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello
&lt;br&gt;my name is so so so
&lt;br&gt;I'm beautiful&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>

3. Build and launch

Explanation:
&lt;h1&gt; is an HTML tag that stands for header. There are six types of html headers: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. And as you can see, we put _Hello, i'm so so so i'm beautiful_ in-between &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; is a css tag used inside an html page. All css styles are put inside or in-between &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;

Therefore, what this css style "_h1{ color: white; }_" does is that it targets all &lt;h1&gt; html tags in our html page (hello.html) and changed the colour of texts in-between &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; to white.
Also note that in our style, we used "color" not "colour" i.e color: white;
