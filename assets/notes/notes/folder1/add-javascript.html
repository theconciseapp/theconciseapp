*Javascript:* often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
There are many uses of Javascript:

- Client-side validation
- To send data to server or request data from server
- Displaying date and time
- To validate the user input before submission of the form
- Open and close new windows
- To display dialog boxes and pop-up windows
- To change the appearance of HTML documents, hide/show html elements
- To create the forms that respond to user input without accessing the server
- To detect user scroll position
- ...and lots more

I will teach you at least two ways to add javascript to a WebView page.

1. Linking to a .js file that contains all our javascripts
2. Adding the Javascript directly in an html page

*--Number 1:-- Linking to a .js file*

let's add javascript file *(my-javascript.js)* in our WebView page(hello.html)
_(You can create *my-javascript.js* on App Builder by clicking the plus(+) icon in *Assets*, after creating it, open it and enter <code>alert("My name is Oluwaseyi");</code> then close it and follow the instruction below)_

- Open *hello.html*
- Put <code>&lt;script src="file:///assets/my-javascript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
+s+_(Just put it before &lt;body&gt; or after &lt;script src="android.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;)_+s+

- Build and launch your app

*--Number 2:--* Adding javascript directly to an html page
- Open *hello.html*
- Put <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("Thank you love");&lt;/script&gt;</code> after &lt;html&gt;.
- Build and install.

*Note:* If you want to use external js(javascript) file (i.e js file that is not created on App Builder or imported to App Builder i.e Js link that starts with https:// or http:// instead of file:///assets), then remember to set permission *INTERNET* in *App Tree* under *Packaging*
