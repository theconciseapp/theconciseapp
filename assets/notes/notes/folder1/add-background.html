Let's add a background to our app and to our webview page( hello.html)

You will notice our app has a default white background, but our WebView page has a transparent background which makes the app's default white background to reflect.

First of all, let's change our App's --*+b+Main+b+ +g+Activity+g+*-- background

1. Go to the *App tree* of your app
<pre>-App
   features
 - Activity | Main</pre>

2. Click on +s+Activity | Main+s+
3. Click on the plus(+) icon at the top to add *background* node
3. Click on the hand icon (at the top left) to change the colour to any preferred colour
4. Build and launch

+s+_See image below for illustration_+s+
[img=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/photos/add-background.png][/img]

+l+Result+l+
[img=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/photos/result-add-background.png][/img]

The above is our app's main activity background i.e immediately you launch your app, you will see the bright pink background( +s+or whatever color you set+s+ ) instead of the default white background.

Now let's change the background of our WebView page (hello.html)
<pre>
 -App
     features
   - Activity | Main
    - features
     - contentView | RelativeLayout
      - views
       - WebView | mywebview
</pre>
1. Click on +s+ - WebView | mywebview
2. Click on the plus sign(+)
3. Select *View* folder from the list of *nodes* that appears
4. Select *android:background* from the list of nodes that appears
5. Now click on the cone & cube icon at the top left +s+( beside the hand icon )+s+
6. Select *color* ( +r+not color folder+r+) from the list of nodes that appears
7. Click on the hand icon to change the color to a different colour 
8. Build and launch your app

When you launched your app, you will notice that we have two different background colours. The first background (from our sample: pink) is our app's main activity background colour while the second (green) is the WebView page background colour
