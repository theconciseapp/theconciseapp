*WebView* is a view that display web pages inside your application. You can also specify HTML string and can show it inside your application using WebView. WebView turns your application to a web application +s+_( Definition from https://www.tutorialspoint.com )_+s+
When using the webview, you can make use of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT just like you are building a website. You can learn Html, Css or Javascript at +s+( https://www.w3schools.com )+s+

3. Click on the plus(+) icon at the top left
4. Enter *hello* or any name you wish, select *html* from the list of buttons below it.
5. Click on ok sign at the top right. Now we have *hello.html*
6. Open it and edit the text *Hello* to anything that comes to your mind. Use &lt;br&gt; for new line.

For example, enter:

<code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;style&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script src="android.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello
&lt;br&gt;my name is so so so
&lt;br&gt;I'm beautiful&lt;/h1&gt;
