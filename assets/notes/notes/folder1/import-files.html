Most times, you would want to add or import some files on your device to your app. Files like photos, icons, js, html, videos e.t.c
Here, i'm also going to teach you how to show images, add js, css on App Builder in your WebView page.

- Open *App Files* of your app
- Open *Assets*
- Click on the import icon at the top right( the icon next to the + icon)
[img=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/photos/import-files.png][/img]
- List of files on your device or file manager should show up
- Select any file _(You can also select multiple files at a timen. Include at least a photo for the purpose of this guide)_

*Result*
[img=file:///assets/notes/notes/folder1/photos/imported-files.png][/img]

Tip: In our guide above, we imported our files directly to the *Assets*, you can organise your files by creating folders first +s+(by clicking on the plus(+) icon in *Assets* )+s+ for  different type of files you want to import or create
i.e folder "Photos" will contain all images, folder "js" will contain all javascripts files e.t.c.
