A *View* is a simple building block of a user interface. It is a rectangular box that can be TextView, EditText, or even a button. It occupies the area on the screen in a rectangular area and is responsible for drawing and event handling. View is a superclass of all the graphical user interface components.

*--Types of Views--*

*+r+WebView+r+* - is a view that display web pages inside your application. It does not include any features of a fully developed web browser (like Chrome, Firefox e.t.c.), such as navigation controls or an address bar. All that WebView does, by default, is show a web page. Web pages can contain Html, Css, Javascript e.t.c.
<!--_+s+(Although, WebView is not actually a type of *View*, the WebView is an extension of Android's View)+s+_-->
*TextView* - TextView is a UI Component that displays the text to the user on their Display Screen.
*EditText* - is a user interface control that allows the users to enter some text.
*Button* - This is a UI that is used to perform some action as soon as the user clicks on it.
*ImageButton* - It is the same as a Button but it’s used to display an image on the button to perform an Action
*ImageView* - helps to display images in an android application. Any image can be selected, we just have to paste our image in a drawable folder from where we can access it.
*CheckBox* - is the UI control that has two states that are either checked or unchecked. If we have a group of CheckBox, we can select as many as we want, unlike RadioGroup.
*Radio button* - is the one that has only two possible states, that are either checked or unchecked. Initially, it is in the unchecked state, once it’s checked it can’t be unchecked.
*RadioGroup* - it’s a group of Radio buttons that are alike. In this, only one of all the buttons can be chosen.
*ListView* -  is a view which groups several items and display them in vertical scrollable list.
Spinner -  Spinners provide a quick way to let user select one value from a set. Similar to a  drop down menu.
