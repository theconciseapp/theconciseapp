*ZIP files in a folder*

*folder.zip(zipFile,callback)*
Zip files in this folder into specified zip file. The zip file is always overwritten, and it never adds files to an existing archive.

*zipFile* - destination (zip) file; may be a string or a File object.

*callback* - (optional) a function to call when the operation is complete.

This method starts a new thread for compressing files and returns control immediately. When the compression is done, *zipFinished* event is fired.

Let' zip all files in "Download" folder of your device ( This may take some seconds depending on how much files in it are ) and save it in documents folder

<code>var folder=android.files.getPublicDir("downloads");
 var newZip=android.files.getPublicDir("documents");

folder.zip( newZip,function( detail){
  
 if( detail.error ) ){
  alert("Error occured: " + detail.error );
 }
   else{
   alert("Successful- Saved to: " + newZip.toString() );
  }
});
</code>


*UNZIP AN ARCHIVE*

*zipFile.unzip(folder,callback)*
Extract files from the zip archive.

folder - the directory where to put extracted files; may be a string or a File object. The directory is created if necessary.

callback - (optional) a function to call when the operation is complete.

This method starts a new thread for extracting files and returns control immediately. When the extraction is done, unzipFinished event is fired.

<code>
var zipFile = new android.File(zipPath);
var folder = new android.File(folderPath);

zipFile.unzip(folder,function(detail){
  if( detail.error ){
  alert("Error occurred: "+detail.error );
  }
   else{
  alert( detail.count + " files extracted");
   }
});
</code>

*zipFile.unzipText(entryName)*

Unzip one entry from this zip file and return it as a string.

*entryName* - the name of the entry in the zip file.

<code>var zipFile = new android.File(zipPath);

 var text = zipFile.unzipText("README.TXT");
  alert(text)
</code>

*visit(callback)*
Visit all files in this folder recursively.

*callback* - a function that takes one parameter(a File object) and returns either true to continue or false to stop.

<code>
var folder = new android.File(folderPath);
folder.visit(function(file){
   console.log("file="+file);
   return true;
});
