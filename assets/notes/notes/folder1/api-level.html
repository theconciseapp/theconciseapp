+r+Note: This API is available if *activity* is set to true in *includeApi*.+r+

Sometimes, you may want to run a function that is not supported by old devices, or you want to run a function only for specific android versions, then it's necessary to check their *Api Level* before calling the function.

*getApiLevel()*
This returns the Android API level. For example, in Android 6.0 it returns 23.

<code>
var api = android.system.getApiLevel();

 if( api>22 ){
  //Run this code for Android 6 and above
  }
</code>
