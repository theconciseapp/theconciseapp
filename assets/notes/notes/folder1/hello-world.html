When we created and launched our first app on App Builder, it displays *+r+Hello+r+* in red color. I'm quite sure you are wondering where the text *Hello* came from.

Now let's change the text to *+r+Hello World+r+*

Open the App tree of your app +s+_(You already know what and where the *App tree* and *App nodes* are. If you don't, go to previous lesson)_+s+

<pre>
  -App
     features
   - Activity | Main
    - features
     - contentView | RelativeLayout
      - views
       - TextView
        - android:text | String | *--Hello--*
</pre>

- Click on *Hello* field as indicated in the image above and then click on the pencil icon at the top to edit the text
- Change the text to *Hello World* and press done or ok sign on your keypad
- Now go back and "Build"

When you launch it, you will see +r+*Hello World*+r+

let's move on!

When you changed the text from "Hello" to "Hello World", you will notice that the editing area is not elegant enough because we used a type of *view* called *TextView* node. Imagine you want to write a readable long sentences with new lines.

*THERE IS A BETTER WAY*

By using a special type of *View* called +g+*WebView*+g+ *node*
