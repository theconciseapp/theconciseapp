*Now let's build  and launch the new app (My App) we just created.*

1. Click on your app name
2. Select "Build" _(Note if you already have a subcription on App Builder, click on "Release" and "Build Apk suitable for distribution" instead. You may need to create a new keystore for the first time)_
3. After App Builder is done with the build, your app should launch automatically _(Note if "Release", you will need to click on "Install" by yourself)_
+s+_(Note that "Build" or "Release" of your app requires your internet to be active. It requires just little data to complete)_+s+

Before we move further, it's good you take note of the following about App Builder:

* If you build your app in debug mode (Build), App Builder is needed to run it i.e Your app will open only if App Builder is running (active) in the background. Your app should be started from App Builder at least once after the last install. This will give your app permission to access files in App Builder.
* When you "Build" (debug mode), your app will only work on your device. Your app won't work if you send it to another phone.
* When you build your app in "Release" mode, your app or the resulting APK and AAB files contain all the needed files and *does not require* App Builder to be installed on the device. You can distribute or share apps built in "Release" mode.
* You need subscription to use "Release" mode. You may subscribe after you are ready to distribute your app with people or to Play store. The subscription is yearly and it's cheap.
