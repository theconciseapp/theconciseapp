Before we go further to explain what is App tree, App nodes, let's define some elements in App Builder app as in the image below

*App Tree* - This is where the logic of your app is defined. We can call it the backbone of your app.
*App Files* - This is where you insert files you want to include in your app: Txt files, Js, Css, Html, Xml, Mp4, Images, Java e.t.c
*Build* - (Also *debug mode*) After you are done with editing, added your files e.t.c any time, you will need to click on "Build" to compile and launch your app. It's called debug mode because you can easily debug your app when you use the "Build".
*Debug* - Check for errors in your app and also to see debugging informations.
*Release* - (Also release mode) Here, you can build app suitable for distribution or sharing to another phone.
*Share* - Save or share the source codes of your app to your memory card or external storage facilities for future import when you change your phone.
*Feedback* - As a developer, you can receive messages from your app. E.g. Crash or error reports e.t.c.
*Rename* - Change the name of your project. Note that this doesn't change the actual name of your app, it only changes the name of your project on App Builder only.

+l+--APP TREE & APP NODE--+l+

An *App Node* is an element of an *App Tree*. Each node contains some information about your app. *All nodes together constitute an App Tree.*

A node may contain other nodes, either as fields or as a list of values. This is what makes an app tree a tree, in the same way as files and directories make a tree-like file system.

Each node has a type which determines the semantics of the node.

Note that nodes cannot be created at run time. They are part of the app tree, and they can only be created at design time.
