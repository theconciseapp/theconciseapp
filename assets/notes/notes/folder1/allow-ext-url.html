+r+Note: This API is available if *webView* is set to true in *includeApi*.+r+

Allow or disallow loading external URLs in this WebView.

*setAllowExternalURLs(true)*

If set to true, external URLs (e.g https:/ /www.google.com) will be allowed to load in this WebView; otherwise an attempt to load an external URL in this WebView will launch a browser activity where user will choose any of the browsers that pops up like Chrome, Firefox, Opera  to open the url.

Note that to load external URLs, you have to declare *INTERNET* permission in the *App Tree*-> *Packaging* -> *Permission* (You don't need to explicitly request Internet permission from user, once you declare it in the *App Tree*, it's automatically granted)

<code>
&lt;script>
android.webView.setAllowExternalURLs(true);
  
location.href="https://www.google.com";
&lt;/script>
</code>

Result:

NOTE: If the original URL (that is set in *App Tree*) of this WebView was an external one (i.e it's not like an *asset* hello.html), then the default value of *setAllowExternalUrl* is true, so you don't need the code above (Check image below)
